# Cyclists Can
## Posters to help educate drivers on rules regarding cyclists.

A recent survey of 1,000 drivers by eBikes Direct ([Cycling Weekly article](http://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/study-reveals-just-how-little-some-motorists-know-about-cyclists-rights-332631)) shows how little education there is for drivers about cyclist's rights. Here's a summary of results:

 - 81% of drivers believe cyclists can't "take the lane"
 - 65% of drivers believe that cyclists must use a bike lane where available
 - 73% of drivers believe that cyclists must not ride two abreast
 - 25% of drivers believe cyclists can ride on pavements
 - 80% of drivers in the South East have shouted at a cyclist
 
Some other common remarks made at cyclists are that:

 - Cyclists don't pay road tax so shouldn't be on the road
 - Cyclists aren't insured so should not be on the road
 - Can't you afford a car?
 - Cars have priority on roads
 
There is obviously a missing link between the highway code and driver knowledge. This is dangerous for all road users as a difference in understanding can lead to dangerous situations, and anger can lead to dangerous driving such as overtaking at a roundabout or on a blind bend.

Cyclists Can is a poster campaign to help remind drivers of the rules that cyclists follow, according to the highway code, to help build a common understanding between road users and increase safety.
